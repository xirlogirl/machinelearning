# Machine Learning  

This repository contains some of the machine learning projects I have worked on independently for personal interest. 
In some cases, the work may be part of an online course or tutorial. 
If the project is part of an online course, I may not include the full details of my solution as many of these courses are
ongoing and this would violate the Honor Code for eg. Coursera.

I will also include projects for fun as well :)

Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats: jupyter notebook included here (ak-dogs-cats-redux-fastai.ipynb)
Followed Fast.ai Lesson 1 & 2. Used a CNN to classify images of dogs vs. cats. This was run on an AWS p2.xlarge instance and fast.ai has provided a script to configure the instance for the projects.
