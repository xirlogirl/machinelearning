# machinelearning

This repository contains some of the machine learning projects I have worked on independently for personal interest. 
In some cases, the work may be part of an online course or tutorial. 
If the project is part of an online course, I may not include the full details of my solution as many of these courses are
ongoing and this would violate the Honor Code for eg. Coursera.

I will also include projects for fun as well :)
