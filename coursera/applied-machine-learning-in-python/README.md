In July 2017 I completed coursera's Applied Machine Learning in Python Course. 

In these files I will provide a quick overview of the concepts covered in this course. As Coursera does not want students to post code from the assignments etc. I will describe some of the techniques that were taught in the course (in my own words) with limited code examples if possible.
