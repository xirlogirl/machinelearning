The assigment for Week 4 was structured like a kaggle competition. A dataset was provided and a certain score was required to pass. Whereas the previous weeks assignments had more instruction and guidance through each step- this one was completely open ended. It was a great confidence builder to show that you could employ the techniques taught and actually get a result on your own. I really enjoyed this assignment! 

The problem was this: "Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?"
