In August 2017 I completed coursera's famous Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng. This course is much more theoretical than the applied course that I was taking simultaneously. The assignments were done in MATLAB and the course was 11 weeks in length- however some weeks did not have programming assignments.

Description of course material learned by me in my own words :)
