In August 2017 I completed coursera's famous Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng. This course is much more theoretical than the applied course that I was taking simultaneously. The assignments were done in MATLAB and the course was 11 weeks in length- however some weeks did not have programming assignments. 


## Week 1 - Linear Regression
This week, we used MATLAB to implement linear regression and gradient descent to minimize the cost function J(Î¸).
Functions were written for gradient descent and the cost function. With these courses, much of the visualization and tests for the code are implicitly built in to simplify grading, so it is a very good idea to look at the skeleton code provided to understand what is going on (mostly plots, and initializing of parameters; similar to test cases)

## Week 2 - Logistic Regression
This week two datasets were classified using logistic regression in MATLAB. Similar to last week's exercise
-sigmoid 
-cost function
-fminuc
-regularization
